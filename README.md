## Installing the Tree-Sitter parser

Installation
- Script executed: `~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/nvim-treesitter/scripts/install-parsers.lua` (from the plugin folder).
- Result: The parser was downloaded, compiled, and installed.

Notes
- Restart Neovim so the parser is loaded.
- If the error persists, please report it — I'll then add a guard configuration.
